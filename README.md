# Rick and Morty
This is a page in which, given a list of characters, collected from an api, the list is shown to the user.

In the first part of the page we see a search form in which we can search for a specific character by name or by species.

Below the search bar we have the option to click on each of the characters to see in detail the character clicked on.
Once in the path of the clicked character, we can go back without refreshing the page and we can see again all the characters obtained from the api.


## Why does this project exist?
It comes from an Adalab exercise of module 3, in which they evaluate my knowledge acquired in this third module in which we have been practising with React.
